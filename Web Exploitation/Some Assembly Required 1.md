**Flag:** `picoCTF{a2843c6ba4157dc1bc052818a6242c3f} `

METHOD:  
1. View page source - go to the JS given
2. put /JIFxzHyW8W in the url inplace of the .js
3. flag at the end of file

### References
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRLA1PQzNXI - to refer which one to input in the URL - all i got was because it has a /, even after using deobfuscator, i can't tell that that's the one being fetched because the array keeps rotating so you never know which one is it gonna be at runtime.
